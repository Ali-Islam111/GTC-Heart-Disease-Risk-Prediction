# GTC-Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction
The Final Project of the GTC Machine Learning Internship that aims to predict heart disease risk using the UCI dataset. The machine learning pipeline includes data preprocessing, training models like Random Forest, and evaluation. The final output is a trained model deployed in a Streamlit web app for real-time user predictions.
